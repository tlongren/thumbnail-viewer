A minimalist image viewer with an effect similar to Lightbox JS, only much faster with a whole lot less Javascript.

== Description ==

[Thumbnail Viewer](http://www.longren.org/wordpress/thumbnail-viewer/ "Thumbnail Viewer")  is simply used to overlay images on a page, similar to Lightbox JS.  The javascript is from the Image Thumbnail Viewer code from [DynamicDrive](http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/thumbnail.htm "DynamicDrive").  The javascript included in Thumbnail Viewer from DynamicDrive is much faster than Lightbox JS, although not as feature packed, which is the entire point.

Thumbnail Viewer works with the following image formats:
png
gif
jpeg
jpg
bmp

== Installation ==

1. Extract thumbnail-viewer folder from downloaded file to wp-contents/plugins/.
2. Go to Plugins section in WordPress dashboard and activate Thumbnail Viewer.
3. Thatâ€™s it!
4. Now all you need to do is add rel=thumbnail to any link tag surrounding your thumbnail.  You'll do this when you're editing a post or page, you can also use the quicktag button for auto-insertion goodness.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Thumbnail Viewer a photo manager? =

Absolutely not.  It simply displays large versions of smaller images (thumbnails) in an unobtrusive yet stylish overlay.

= Can images in the form of WordPress attachments be displayed? =

Nope, see previous answer.

= Where can I find support? =
Visit [http://www.longren.org/](http://www.longren.org/contact/ "longren.org") and get in touch with me (Tyler) there.

= Why can't I see the quicktag when I'm writing a new post or editing an existing post? =

If you're using the Visual Editor, click on the Code tab, you'll see the quicktag there.
